def generate_collaborative_response(user_input, personas):
    primary_response = personas.primary.generate(user_input)
    
    enhancements = []
    for supporting_persona in personas.supporting:
        enhancement = supporting_persona.enhance(primary_response)
        enhancements.append(enhancement)
    
    final_response = integrate_responses(primary_response, enhancements)
    
    return calibrate_temperature(final_response, personas)
```
